The `tools` list should contain dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'arguments' keys, corresponding to the tools to be used and their respective arguments. The `arguments` should be a dictionary, with keys corresponding to the argument names and the values corresponding to the requested values. If a tool does not require any arguments, the `arguments` dictionary should be empty.
